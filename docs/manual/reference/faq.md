# FAQ

The questions people actually ask before they install. Short answers, grounded in what the code does.

## Do I need an API key?

No, not to start. Urfael runs your installed `claude` CLI as a subprocess, so it rides your existing Claude Code login (Pro or Max). If `claude` works in your terminal, the daemon works. There is no key to paste and nothing to connect. The installer fetches a checksum-pinned local speech model, so even voice needs no key.

One exception: non-Anthropic models. If you route to GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, or a local model through a proxy, that runs on your own provider keys. The Claude subscription only covers Anthropic models. Also note: if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is in your environment, it overrides the subscription. Details in features/models.md.

## Does it open a port?

No. The brain is a local daemon reachable only through a `0600` unix socket. It never opens a TCP port, so nothing on the LAN or the internet can reach it. The topology is one-way: Urfael reaches out (to your `claude` login and the chat APIs it polls), nothing reaches in.

The optional dashboard (`urfael dashboard`), the OpenAI-compatible API (`urfael serve`), and the webhook receiver all bind `127.0.0.1` only. They are loopback, token or secret gated, and unreachable off the machine. The only genuinely inbound surfaces are opt-in and you tunnel them yourself: the WhatsApp bridge (HMAC-verified) and the webhook receiver (per-hook 256-bit secret). Neither opens a port on your behalf. See security/model.md.

## What does it cost?

Flat. It runs on your Claude Code subscription, so idle costs nothing beyond it and there is no per-token meter. You can still see usage: token counts and an estimated daily, 7-day, and 30-day spend show up in the Console's Hearth panel, the dashboard, and `urfael status`. The spend figure is an estimate (the rate is env-overridable), not an asserted bill.

If you want to run Urfael as a shared service or at production scale, use an Anthropic API key instead of a subscription, which is metered per token.

## Where is my data?

Local. Two places, both yours:

- The **vault** (`~/Urfael`), an Obsidian vault, holds its knowledge and archive.
- A **private local git repo** (`~/Urfael-memory`) holds what it learns. Every conversation, from every surface, is archived as plain JSONL in `~/Urfael-memory/sessions/`, versioned and grep-able by you.

Nothing is pooled across users and no tokens are stored. With a local model and the already-local voice, nothing leaves the machine at all. See features/memory.md.

## Can a teammate read my secrets?

No. Multiple people can use Urfael, each a sandboxed principal through the same fail-closed kernel, where a role can only narrow access, never escalate. Remote and shared turns run read-only with no network egress, and the vault's `permissions.deny` blocks `~/.claude` and `~/.ssh` as a hard boundary that holds even in full-capability mode. An injected "read a secret and send it out" has nothing to read and nowhere to send. `urfael audit` gives an auditor the who, when, and what trail. See security/team.md.

## Which OS?

macOS on Apple Silicon or Intel is the primary, best-tested target. Linux is supported but newer and less battle-tested: the headless core, voice, and Electron GUI run there, with far less mileage. The installer detects Linux and writes `systemd --user` units instead of launchd plists. Native Windows is supported in beta — `install.ps1` in PowerShell (or WSL for the POSIX-only extras). See start/install.md.

## Is it production-ready?

Be honest: it is young. Every feature is verified end-to-end by an in-repo harness (`npm run e2e`) against a live daemon, and the security-critical paths ship adversarial regression tests. The security benchmark (`npm run security`) boots the real daemon and dashboard and attacks them: the latest run resisted 11 of 11 attack classes across 128 checks.

What that does not buy you is scale. This is a personal tool. The live relay of the Matrix, Signal, and WhatsApp bridges, the QQ, SimpleX, and PSTN phone bridges, and the eight native webhook channels has not been exercised against real accounts (their parsing and allowlist logic is unit-tested and frozen as benchmark checks); the certified core is Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, and Email. It is security-tested, not battle-tested at scale. That is the one thing only time and users add.
